# Odoo_Estate
Custom Odoo module for getting started guide, uploading to GitHub
as a showcase for basic custom module development, and as a reference 
as those can be scarce for Odoo.

>**Rev.1**: This repo will be updated to include advanced tutorials and aspects of Odoo development.
The following is an index of the lessons and features covered in this repo corresponding to the commit history.
1. Getting Started(1-36)
2. Unit Tests(37-?)

## How to use
*This is assuming you have your environment configured and ready to go, if not consult
Odoo dev docs getting started guide*
<br>
<br>
If running odoo locally with bin command, either add the 
files to the addons folder. Or add path to folder containing the module
as part of the addons command through CLI(Don't forget to install the app after).
<br>
<br>
If running with Odoo SH(cloud solution), clone and push to the
repo and install the module from the apps menu.
<br>
<br>
If using as a reference for Odoo developer tutorial, check the commit history if you can't find the solution line 
within the codebase easily.
The commit message should offer a hint as to what lesson it was for. :thumbsup:
